# SlamPy

![Python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-python%203.8-brightgreen) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/GiordanoLaminetti/SlamPy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/GiordanoLaminetti/SlamPy) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/slampy/badge/?version=latest)](https://slampy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


This project is a python wrapper to SLAM algorithms.

At the moment, we provide support for:

* ORB_SLAM2
* ORB_SLAM3

## ORB_SLAM2 / ORB_SLAM3 requirement

Python wrapper to ORB SLAM 2 can be found at [ORB_SLAM2-PythonBindings](https://github.com/GiordanoLaminetti/ORB_SLAM2-PythonBindings) for ORB_SLAM2 and [ORB_SLAM3-PythonBindings](https://github.com/GiordanoLaminetti/ORB_SLAM2-PythonBindings/tree/ORBSLAM3) for ORB_SLAM3

## Example of usage with ORB_SLAM2

the jupyter notebook **example_usage** shows how to use ORB_SLAM2 with a sequence of the KITTI dataset

## Change the settings

to change the algorithm settings you can modify the **setting.yaml** file in the line

> SLAM.alg:'insert here your .py file that contains the wrapper class'

you can add at the file the other params that the method needs.
to change from ORB_SLAM2 to ORB_SLAM3 you need to change only the **SLAM.alg** entry.

### ORB_SLAM2/3 params

the params needed for this 2 algorithms are:

* a vocabulary file
* a setting file with the intrinsics parameters of the cameras and other configuration params

We provided the vocabulary file and the configuration file for ORB_SLAM2/3 for the KITTI_02 camera and the TUM freiburg3 camera in the **slam_metohd/Settings** folder, but you can add your owns using as model the files currently provided.


### Docker

We provide a container on dockerhub, in which all all the dipendences and the repository are already installed. 

```
docker pull giordanolaminetti/slampy:latest
```
When the image is ready, you can create a new container running:

```
NAME="orb"
DATAPATH="/PATH/TO/KITTI/DATE/DRIVE_SYNC_FOLDER/"
sudo docker run -it \
                --name $NAME \
                --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/pyslam \
                -v $DATAPATH:"/pyslam/Dataset":ro \
                -p 8888:8888 \
                giordanolaminetti/slampy tmux
```

Doing so, the created container contains both the code and the Dataset (in read-only mode to prevent wrong behaviours)

You can have a test with the `jupyter` example running:

```
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0
```
